    "\n",
    "In this notenook, we will first review the background, and then go quickly through the computational proceess as described in the original references. We then return to the individual parts for more details in the other notebooks. The aim is to first obtain a feel of the outcomes and how data is represented with the hope that with that the individual parts become more transparent and applicable to other problems as well. In addition to water, in the following notebooks we will also use a simple lattice as an example since that allows the demonstration of some important properties before applying the methods to more complex systems."

While Voronoi tesellation is a powerful and provides access distributions, $g_3$ allows arguably a more sensititve the detection of structural variations and changes between them. Arguably, from the physical perspective, $g_3$  provides a more complete description (than the typical methods) of the local structure by including angular correlations that are directly related to the directionality of interatomic forces.
